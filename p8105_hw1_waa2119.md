\#P8105 HW 1 Assignment

This loads the penguins data set

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The penguins data set contains the following information in each
    column: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
    flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year

    -   The penguin species ranges from Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap

    -   The islands these penguins reside on is Torgersen, Biscoe and
        Dream

    -   The sex of these penguins are both male and female

    -   The year this data was collected ranges between 2007, 2008, and
        2009

-   The size of the penguins data set is 344 rows by 8 columns

-   The mean flipper length of all penguins in the data set is
    200.9152047 mm

Now we will make a scatter plot of flipper length vs bill length

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
